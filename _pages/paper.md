The Vanishing of a Communication Infrastructure: The “Right Time” Cultural Memory of Newsstands
=====
* Shi,Y. (2025, June). The Vanishing of a Communication Infrastructure: The “Right Time” Cultural Memory of Newsstands [Completed Paper]. 75th Annual ICA Conference. Information Systems Division. Denver, CO.
* Abstract: This article focuses on a highly viewed video on the Chinese video platform Bilibili, examining how the memory production surrounding newsstands during a “right time” reflects their symbolic significance, particularly their role as communication infrastructure. Through the use of LDA topic modeling and sentiment analysis of over 10000 comments, the article finds that memories of newsstands largely center on childhood recollections, the transmission of information through magazines and newspaper, and the maintenance of interpersonal relationships. Various kinds of nostalgia foster a sense of identity, further broadening the scope of nostalgia. The discussions tell the story of the disappearance of newsstands as “communication infrastructure,” symbolizing their place in cultural memory. This illustrates the new forms and topics emerging in memory research within social media contexts.

Political homogeneity and the dissemination of misinformation on Mastodon and X

* Xiong, S., Guo, L*., Shi, Y., Min, S. Luo, Y & Chen, Y. (2025, Oct). Political homogeneity and the
dissemination of misinformation on Mastodon and X [Extended Abstract]. ICA Regional Conference,
Hefei, China.
* Abstract: Social media has become a primary source of information worldwide, yet platform structures shape how content spreads. This study examines how political homogeneity influences misinformation dissemination on Mastodon, a decentralized platform with self-selected communities, using X as a comparison. We investigate whether echo chamber effects exist in Mastodon instances and whether homogeneous communities amplify belief-consistent misinformation in proportion and diffusion speed. Drawing on computational communication methods, we identify communities, estimate user political stances, and measure homogeneity. Misinformation posts are verified against fact-checking databases, and multilevel regression models assess the relationship between homogeneity and misinformation patterns. We anticipate that highly homogeneous communities accelerate the spread of belief-consistent misinformation by reinforcing group identity. Findings highlight that even without algorithmic curation, structural features of decentralized platforms may foster misinformation persistence, suggesting that effective interventions must combine design changes and behavioral strategies to promote exposure to diverse content and mitigate information isolation.
