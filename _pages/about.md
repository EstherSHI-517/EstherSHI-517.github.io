**Welcome!** I am an undergraduate student at [Fudan University, School of Journalism, Department of  Communication](https://xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/NewsEn/main.htm) in Shanghai, China. 

My research explores the relationship between communication technologies and human behaviors within certain societal and political contexts. I investigate how technological advancements shape political discourse, social media engagement, and online news production. 

I mostly use computational and quantitative methods, but I also have experienced in qualitative method such as in-depth interview. My technical skills include programming languages such as Python and R, as well as proficiency in Stata, SPSS, and visualization tools like Adobe Photoshop.

Recently, my work focused on how short-video platforms influence public perception and engagement, as well as the production and consumption of online news.

I like cooking and baking in my spare time. Also, I run and play tennis regularly. I am a fan of classical guitar and are recently learning how to play it.

You can find my CV here: [Yiru Shi's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). You can contact me through [email](mailto:yiru_shi@outlook.com).
