The Vanishing of a Communication Infrastructure: The “Right Time” Cultural Memory of Newsstands

* Citation Information: Shi,Y. (2025, June). The Vanishing of a Communication Infrastructure: The “Right Time” Cultural Memory of Newsstands [Completed Paper]. 75th Annual ICA Conference. Information Systems Division. Denver, CO.
* Abstract: This article focuses on a highly viewed video on the Chinese video platform Bilibili, examining how the memory production surrounding newsstands during a “right time” reflects their symbolic significance, particularly their role as communication infrastructure. Through the use of LDA topic modeling and sentiment analysis of over 10000 comments, the article finds that memories of newsstands largely center on childhood recollections, the transmission of information through magazines and newspaper, and the maintenance of interpersonal relationships. Various kinds of nostalgia foster a sense of identity, further broadening the scope of nostalgia. The discussions tell the story of the disappearance of newsstands as “communication infrastructure,” symbolizing their place in cultural memory. This illustrates the new forms and topics emerging in memory research within social media contexts.
